# Data structure

Repositories consist of tasks (programs) by which I analyze and learn the performance of basic data types and structures: arrays and arrays, stack, row, single and double linked lists, trees, binary trees, balanced binary trees, hash tables, sets, and charts. I used sorting and retrieval techniques, scattering, memory waste collection, and memory usage control, and apply basic knowledge of algorithm complexity.
